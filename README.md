Startup CSS and HTML: I learned that using a single css file to make all the pages have similar formats made the whole things much easier. I only had to edit the css for individual pages for only a small portion of the webpage.

Simon javaScript: I learned that javaScript is a lot different in functionality than css or java, and catching errors is much more of a pain in the butt.

Startup javaScript: I learned that, as the name implies, localStorage only stores information on devices locally, so if i want my website to have the functionality of having actual friends, ill need to create an sql database and a bunch more headachey stuff

Simon Service: I learned that node.js is and express are very confusing and I'm still figuring out how they work and how to use them... I have a small grasp on http requests, but thats about it

Simon-db: I learned how there are different ways to store data than just an sql file, and that there are services online to store that data remotely for you to access

Simon Login: I think it's funny how I'm doing a login assignment for my other programming class, and while they are both for similar purposes, the implementation of them is completely different. It really goes to show how many different ways there are to program something depending on the specific needs.

Simon Websocket After dealing with the headache that is http requests in my other class, I think I like websocket a lot more...
